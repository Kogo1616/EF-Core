# EF Core Repository

This repository contains my personal learning exercises, code snippets, and project examples using **Entity Framework Core**.

📚 The examples are inspired by concepts from books, official documentation, and hands-on practice.  
They cover topics like:

- DbContext configuration
- Migrations and seeding
- Relationships (1:1, 1:N, N:N)
- LINQ queries
- Tracking vs NoTracking
- In-memory databases and testing
- Fluent API vs Data Annotations
- Clean Architecture with EF Core
